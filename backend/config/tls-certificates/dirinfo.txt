This file is here just for making git to create this directory. 
Place the certification chains of all other servers here. For each server put the whole chain into one .pem file, named [target.host.domain].pem. Replace [target.host.domain] with the complete dns name of the target host.
You can call php -f backend/admin/retrieve.tls.php to automatically do it.
